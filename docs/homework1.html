    <h1>What is Statistics?</h1>
    <p>
      Statistics is the branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It helps us understand patterns, trends, and relationships within data, allowing us to make informed decisions under uncertainty.

    <h2>Why is Statistics Useful for Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>
      In cybersecurity, statistics plays a crucial role in identifying and preventing threats by analyzing data patterns and anomalies. It helps security professionals detect unusual behavior, predict cyber attacks, evaluate risk levels, and measure the effectiveness of security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      By applying statistical methods, cybersecurity experts can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detect anomalies in network traffic that may indicate intrusion attempts.</li>
      <li>Analyze the probability and impact of various cyber threats.</li>
      <li>Improve malware detection through pattern recognition.</li>
      <li>Estimate vulnerabilities and prioritize defenses based on risk assessments.</li>
      <li>Continuously monitor and improve security strategies through data-driven insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real Examples of Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "Let me share some real-world events where statistics made a difference in cybersecurity:
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In 2017, during the Equifax breach that compromised personal data of around 147 million people, statistical analyses helped identify how attackers exploited a known software vulnerability. This showed the importance of continuous vulnerability monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same year, the WannaCry ransomware attack spread rapidly by exploiting a Windows vulnerability. Statistics about attack patterns and timing enabled experts to predict which systems were at highest risk and to deploy timely patches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2015 Ukraine power grid attack, anomaly detection through statistical network behavior analysis helped attribute the attack to a specific hacker group, aiding defensive responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013, the Target data breach, which affected 110 million customers, saw the use of statistical models to spot unusual transaction patterns, crucial in identifying fraudulent activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the massive Yahoo breaches compromising billions of accounts were understood better thanks to statistical analysis of access patterns and authentication failures, revealing the scale and persistence of the attacks.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      These examples show how essential statistics is in defending against cyber threats by making sense of vast data to spot patterns, predict risks, and respond effectively."
