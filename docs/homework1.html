    <h2>Understanding Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Statistics</strong> is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. 
      It helps us understand patterns and trends hidden in large datasets, 
      providing a solid foundation for decision-making under uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevance in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      In <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, statistics plays a crucial role in identifying anomalies, 
      detecting intrusions, and assessing risks. By analyzing network traffic, user behavior, 
      or system logs, statistical models can reveal patterns that indicate potential attacks or vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, statistical techniques such as <em>outlier detection</em> can signal unusual activity 
      in a network, while <em>probabilistic models</em> help estimate the likelihood of future threats.
      These tools allow security experts to respond faster and more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In short, statistics transforms raw data into actionable insights. 
      For cybersecurity professionals, it is not just a mathematical tool â€” it is a way to 
      anticipate, detect, and mitigate digital threats in an increasingly data-driven world.
